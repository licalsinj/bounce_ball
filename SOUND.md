# Sound Ideas

## General Thoughts
These are some ideas I have about my sounds for the game.

I'd like to play a "note" whenever the user crosses a boundary between colored buckets.
I'd like those notes to be in some kind of scale pattern.
  Maybe something natural or a little jazzy if you're in dark mode
I'd also like it to beep in a certain way if you bounce off a wall.
Then there will be sounds for other random stuff.

Here's a list of the sound effects I think I'll need:

- Bouncing off Walls
  - Thinking the Doe sound an octave apart
- Crossing Boundaries
  - Rae to Tee on a scale
  - Thinking I can use the same sound for all just shifted in pitch(?)
- Dropping the Ball
  - Something neutral but fun
  - Maybe a complimentary sharp?
- Sorting Correctly
  - Positive Win Feedback Sound
- Sorting Incorrectly
  - Negative Lose sound (longer)
- Pausing
  - Quick Neutral beep
- Clicking on Pause Menu
  - Neutral tactile feedback


## To Do
- [ ] Get sound working in general
- [ ] Get sound pitch shifting working
- [ ] Get sound to play when crossing boundaries
- [ ] Add other sound effects
